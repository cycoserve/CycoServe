### Project Overview

**CycoServe** is an open-source platform that combines advanced AI technology with a modular web framework to provide scalable solutions for digital marketing, AI-driven content management, and more. Built with React (Next.js) and Python, CycoServe is designed for flexibility and rapid development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later
* **npm**: Version 6.x or later
* **Python**: Version 3.8 or later
* **Git**: Version control system

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the CycoServe repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cycoserve/cycoserve.git
    cd cycoserve
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install the necessary Node.js and Python dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    If there are any additional Python dependencies, make sure to install them as well. Check for a `requirements.txt` or equivalent file for Python dependencies.
3.  **Create Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference:

    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    ```

### Configuration

Make any necessary configurations for your development or production environment. For example, configure database connections, API endpoints, or any third-party services you might be using.

1.  **Database Setup**

    Ensure your database is set up according to the instructions provided in the documentation. Apply any necessary migrations or seed data.
2.  **API Integration**

    Configure your API endpoints and ensure that all required services are available.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server**

    To run the application locally, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Build for Production**

    To build the application for production, use:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Then start the production server with:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
